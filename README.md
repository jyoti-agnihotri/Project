Mitron Bank : analysis for new Credit card launch. 

Problem Statement 

AtliQ Data Services came to know about this through an internal link and approached Mitron Bank with a proposal to implement this project. However, the strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr. Bashnir Rover is skeptical and asked them to do a pilot project with the sample data before handing over them the full project. They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their online spending and other details. 
Peter Pandey is a data analyst at AtliQ Data Services and was asked by his manager to take over this project. His role is to analyse the provided sample data and report key findings to the strategy team of Mitron Bank. This analysis is expected to guide them in tailoring the credit cards to customer needs and market trends.
